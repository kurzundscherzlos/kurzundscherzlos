You finally found the door, unlocked it with the rusty key, stepped inside and couldn't believe your own eyes. What you saw was stunning.

For not less than two hours did you wander around in the hallways of the big castle, where your great grandfather once employed a dozen men and women. House maids, gardeners, a butler and two cooks, of which one also drove the white Bentley with the red leather seats and the wooden steering wheel, made of dark oak. As a vivid reader of gothic horror stories, you expected the chamber within the castle's cellars. Who could have guessed, it being on the ground floor -- hidden in plain sight? When you slowly went up the steep stairs from the cellar to the main foyer, tired from your search and sadly disappointed from not finding what you so badly wished to find, you thought about your old man. About how he, decades ago, went on the same journey on which you are right now, looking for the same chamber, you were so badly trying to find. You thought about all the times, he was reading to you the letters he once got from his father. All the times you sat on his lap, trying to figure out what all the puzzles meant, and where they may lead. Reaching the top of the stairway, you wonder, if they even lead *any*where. You see your father going mad; so mad, one day he disappeared and was never heard of again, until a few weeks ago, you got the text from your family lawyer, saying that he passed away and left you not only the castle, but the mysterious letters from your great grandfather as well.

> The fruit so sweet, with age comes its taste...

Most of the letters were destroyed from the same age, giving the fruits their taste. But what did this puzzle meant to tell you? You do not know. You thought you did, but you searched for every possible clue inside the wine cellar, without finding a single thing bringing you closer to the hidden chamber and its secret treasure. Destroyed by time and possibly fire, the letters were incomplete and nearly useless. You know there *is* a treasure. But you neither know what it is nor where it could be found. As a child, you only have been down in the wine cellar one single time. Lots of people from nearby were invited to the jubilee your mother hosted in the castle. A game of hide and seek brought you down here but made you even more frightened of the place than the stories of your father and you grandfather already did. Though, standing in these catacombs, filled with barrels full of wine, you get the feeling, those stories were all about keeping you and your siblings as far away from the alcohol as they can. And those stories worked their wonders. A lot of time went by without seeing the old wooden barrels with the rusty metal rings.
