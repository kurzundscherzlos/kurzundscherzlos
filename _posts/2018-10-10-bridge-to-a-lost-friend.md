> The rain is falling down the sky  
> And I want you to know how I feel  
> My heart wants to follow you  
> But I don't know where you are
>  
> I feel the pulse inside my veins  
> I know my life has been changed  
> It feels so lonely without you
>  
> I know you feel the pain inside  
> I know you see how I cry  
> All the tears all the grief all the memories we will keep  
> All the moments we have spent  
> Last until the end
>  
> It is told that heaven is a place  
> Of eternal life  
> No fear no hate and loneliness  
> No darkness only love
>  
> I know your life is going on  
> In our hearts and in this song  
> I hope you feel well in heaven
>  
> I know you feel the pain inside  
> I know you see how I cry  
> All the tears all the grief all the memories we will keep  
> All the moments we have spent  
> Last until the end
>  
> You know time is running through  
> It takes time to find your way  
> And I believe coming back to you  
> And hold you in my arms every day
>
> The days are gone years will pass  
> Centuries leave but we will last  
> 'til life decides to let us meet
>  
> I know you feel the pain inside  
> I know you see how I cry  
> All the tears all the grief all the memories we will keep  
> All the moments we have spent  
> Last until the end
>
